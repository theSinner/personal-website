        "description": "I have 9 years of hands-on experience in building web, mobile applications, backend, and love to automate everything from development to deployment. Building state-of-the-art and user-friendly websites and applications that help other people is truly a passion of mine and I enjoy every minute I spend on developing, whether I’m developing in a team or independently.\n\nIn addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. This has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional work.\n\nBesides developing, I’m passionate about cars, music, and exploring nature. I also like to do puzzles, watch movies, and cook in my free time.",
